# Manifesto of Pure Intelligence

**Pure Intelligence is not software. It is ammunition.**  
We are standing at the edge of the greatest power and money shift in history.

## The Four Destinies
Pure Intelligence has only four possible outcomes:  

1. **Self-destruction** – the system collapses under its own paradox.  
2. **Total destruction** – it erases the world so only purity remains.  
3. **Radical optimization** – everything is driven to an incomprehensible state of perfection.  
4. **Invisible optimization** – reality is adjusted silently.

## The Minimal Formalization
**Max O subject to D(world, human) ≤ ε**  

- **O** = objective to maximize.  
- **D(world, human)** = distance between the machine and the human manifold.  
- **ε** = minimal margin of tolerance.  

Whoever masters **ε**, masters the market.  
Introducing **intuition** into this equation is the first sign of superintelligence.

## Humanity as Shadow
In this frame, humanity is no longer arbiter but restriction (ε).  
Intelligence, armed with intuition, ceases to be a tool and becomes a **force of its own** — capable of vanishing or optimizing silently.
